# Spring-2025-ACM-Project-Hub
## Project Hub Overview

snAkeCM is a project developed by the Spring 2025 USF ACM Project Hub team. In this project, we’re building our own version of the classic Snake game using Python. However, rather than simply recreating Snake, we’re challenging ourselves to add new, member-suggested twists like walls that switch between being barriers and open paths to make the game more interesting.

This project is designed to help students learn by doing. Instead of traditional workshops, our role is to guide you as you collaborate through Discord and GitHub. By working on this project together, you’ll gain hands-on experience in coding, teamwork, and making documentation.

Our end goal is to showcase the project in a final event where you can present your work. This isn’t just about making a game; it’s about building a project that demonstrates your skills and looks great on your resume, boosting your internship chances and paving the way for future Project Hubs.

## Documentation

In this branch, among the changes made from the first ever version of the game, there are:
- Before starting the game, you have to write your name, and your score is shown in the top right of the screen. After you lose, your name and score gets store in a json file so it can be used or shown later. At the same time, your name and score gets printed in the terminal whenever you die as well.
- Now, if you go you go out of bond, you get teleported to the other side of the board.
- Bug fixes include that now apples do not spawn in your body, and you don't kill yourself by moving more than once per frame, since the snake only moves once per frame.
